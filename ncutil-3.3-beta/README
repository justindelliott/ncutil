****************** THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE! ******************

I make no guarantees as to the function  of  this  software,
proper  or  improper.   Use at  your own  risk.  That  being
said, the only way  to  really  screw-up  your  system  with
this software is to use it improperly,  in which case you're
to blame anyway!

****************** THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE! ******************


Starting in this version of ncutil the NCUtilFoundation framework
has been merged right into the executable.  I heard of no one
linking against it, etc, so there's no reason to complicate
matters by having it around.  The only drawback to its deprecation
is that ncutil can no longer have localized strings.  Cest la
vie.


This beta package consists of four distinct executables, arranged
according to target OS variant:

  - if you're using pure Darwin, not Mac OS X, use the Darwin
    path
  - if you're using Mac OS X, use the MacOSX path

then by release of the OS -- there are some key changes in 10.5
that are taken into account in that version:

  - Per-service Windows SMB entity
  - Deprecation of NetInfo entities
